Terra Nova draws on familiar elements from management and simulation titles such as The Sims, Rimworld, and Oxygen Not Included, but creates a niche in one of its core mechanics: the perspective switch between playing as an individual in the first person and having a broad overview. This document describes a proposed Alpha version of Terra Nova, suitable for early playtesting, design ideation, and examination of the projectâ€™s technical feasibility.
